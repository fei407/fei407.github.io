## Overview
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter, United Kingdom. I am supervised by [Prof. Jia Hu](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/24926-jia-hu) and [Prof. Geyong Min](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/23192-geyong-min) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter, United Kingdom. I also work closely with [Prof. Shiqiang Wang](https://shiqiang.wang/).
I received the M.Eng. degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), China, in 2022.

My research interests focus on **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**, **Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models**, **Efficient AI Systems**, and **Algorithm–Hardware Co-design**.
