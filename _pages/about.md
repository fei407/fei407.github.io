## Overview
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter, United Kingdom, 
under the supervision of [Prof. Jia Hu](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/24926-jia-hu) and [Prof. Geyong Min](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/23192-geyong-min)
I also work in close collaboration with [Prof. Shiqiang Wang](https://shiqiang.wang/).
I received my M.Eng. degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2022.

My research interests focus on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models, Efficient AI Systems, and Algorithm-Hardware Co-design.

My Ph.D. study is fully funded by the China Scholarship Council and the University of Exeter.
